# recipes/

This tree defines the buildable images and the reusable layers they compose.

The repo is role-first.

- `workstation` is the flagship desktop role.
- `server` is the headless admin/operator role.
- GNOME and COSMIC are workstation environments under the workstation role.

Supported published tags are short and come from the shipped image matrix rather than from the internal filenames.

## How images relate

- Server recipes build from an explicit distro core plus `shared/full.yml`.
- Workstation recipes build from an explicit distro core plus the shared workstation and environment layers.
- Fedora has both workstation and server recipes.
- The machine-readable support contract lives in `files/base/runtime/usr/share/myos/image-matrix.tsv`.
- Retired product lines stay deleted; if the product model changes, update the manifest first and then add recipes intentionally.

## Reading order

1. open the target image under `recipes/images/**`
2. follow each `from-file:` in order
3. use `recipes/layers/README.md` to understand what each layer is allowed to own
4. use `files/README.md` when a `files` module pulls payload trees
